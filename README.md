# What does Opportunity Insight Data tell us about the racial makeup of Californian colleges in 2000?

## Background
The issue of race and college admittance has been a controversial topic for years. Colleges for years have placed emphasis on creating a more diverse and inclusive community that encourages ecclectic and motivated thinkers. While this is somewhat of an uncontroversial approach to education, concerns on racial quotas and affirmative action force individuals to question whether college admittance is purely merit based or partially motivated by ethnic background. This is typically the argument when a highly accomplished student is not accepted to the university of their dream. However, 

This project will investigate the racial makeup of four year colleges and university in California from the year 2000.  

## Business Question
What does Opportunity Insight Data tell us about the racial makeup of Californian colleges in 2000?

## Data Source
Data on racial composition in America college populations was collected through Opportunity Insight data.

From there, data was filtered to remove non-CA and non-four year institutions. Colleges were also removed if they did not include data on one or more racial group. Others are considered mostly Caucassian but have the potential to include Native Americans as well.
